        DANDY IN THE UNDERWORLD
        5.5% ABV
        The main Dandy. This beer is our most popular offering and available everywhere, all the time. A light body with notes of coffee, chocolate,
         and light roast, this traditional Oyster Stout is sure to be a favourite.
        
        Pairs well with oysters, fish, and other salty snacks.
        
        THE DANDY WILD SOUR ALE
        7.3% ABV
        
        A bold, malty sour ale soured with lacto-bacillus and fermented with a wild yeast strain. An upfront sourness is balanced with notes of
        green mango, Sauvignon Blanc, and pineapple.
        
        T2G-IPA
        7.5% ABV
        
        A bold IPA that is all sorts of Dandy. Choosing not to take sides, this rich IPA has a present bitterness balanced with a juicy
         citrus aroma.
        
        DANDY LAGER
        5% ABV
        
        An import style premium lager brewed with toasted rice and the finest Alberta malt. Thoughtfully hopped with prime German hops, for a
         subtle citrus aroma, this beer is crisp and fresh. Premium in name, Dandy in Nature.

        BALTUS VAN TASSEL: CHERRY SOUR
        7% ABV<br>
        FALL<br>

        shorter days and colder weather.
        
        IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER: BLACK IPA<br>
        6.5% ABV<br>
        WINTER<br>
         A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh and juicy but dark as the coldest days of winter. Citra and 
         Mosaic are<br> late hop additions to avoid the biterness and focus on aroma.<br><br>
        
        THE JUNGLE BIRD: TROPICAL DARK SOUR<br>
        5% ABV<br>
        SPRING<br>
        An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail. This beer has notes of demerara sugar, bitter lime, tropical pineapple coming together for a<br>
        refreshing sour that is like no other.<br><br>
        
        BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS: HOPPED WHEAT ALE<br>
        5.5% ABV<br>
        SUMMER<br> 
        English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave in England, this beer is designed to refresh in the hot summer sun.
        Dry,<br> with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a touch of biterness and<br>
        a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!<br>
